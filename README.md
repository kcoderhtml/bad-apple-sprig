# Bad Apple on the Spri

To generate your own code run `./img-covert.sh -i frames/ -o frames/resized/ -w 24 -h 18` to generate the resized images then `python3 map-gen.py` where it will ask you how long you want the generated animation to be. The output will be in `./map.js` and can be put directly into the sprig editor and flashed to your sprig. A youtube version is also available [here](https://youtu.be/NOZrx_0zf-s).
